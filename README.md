# DAY 1 (2/8)
- I'm curious to learn all about Artificial Intelligence such as machine learning, computer vision, image processing, natural language processing, in the fields like finance and more. I would like to learn what else is out there and how to use it. And how to connect with professionals and start an internship or full-time.

1.What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning? 

Supervised learning is having the training data and knowing the outcome labels of those like cat or dog. Uses decision tree algorithm.
Unsupervised learning is having the training data then trying to group them into clusters to find similarity. Uses K nearest neighbor algorithm. 

2.Describe why the following statement is FALSE: Scikit-Learn has the power to visualize data without a Graphviz, Pandas, or other data analysis libraries.

Scikit Learn is focused on Machine Learning, e.g data modelling. It is not concerned with the loading, handling, manipulating, and visualising of data.

1. What are “Tensors” and what are they used for in Machine Learning? 

They are vectors with basis (1 unit of anything I’m using) and have 3 subcomponents like vector A has xyz sub components. 
They are the same from any observer and reference frame. Can have multiple directions.


2.What did you notice about the computations that you ran in the TensorFlow 
programs (i.e. interactive models) in the tutorial? 

They are all arrays.

Problem: Predicting stock market 

Data: Huge Stock Market Dataset https://www.kaggle.com/borismarjanovic/price-volume-data-for-all-us-stocks-etfs 

Algorithm: Convolutional neural networks. 

I learned about batches would take a section of training data. The whole data is one epoch.

Sarcasim notebook that removes common words and converts them to vectors then tests which headlines are sarcastic or not.
I learned that I need to use a sequenal model and to visual data at every step to make sure that samples are balanced for example.

# Day 8 (2/15)

In the convolutional neural network, I learned that the CNN has an optional Pooling layer which increases the accuracy. The pooling layer takes a section and calculates the max and average of all the pixels in that section.

# Day 9 (2/16)

Bias in the vision and languge of AI was that it labels yellow banana instead of banana like people would because people don't say yellow because it's common. I also remember reading about the AI creating a model on past successful resumes which was biased and applying it to current people.

Convolutional Neural Network breaks up a image into smaller parts and then analyzes each feature in isolation which then make a decision about the image as a whole.

Convolutional layer filters an image, scanning a few pixels at a time and creating a feature map that predicts the class to which each feature belongs to.

Pooling layer (downsampling) keeps the most important parts of the convolutional layer. Several rounds of convolutional and pooling.

Fully Connected Neural Network is taking the results from the convolution/pooling process and use them to classify the image into a label.

Fully connected input layer takes the output of the previous layers and flattends them into a single vector.

First fully connected layer takes the inputs from the feature analysis and applies weights to predict the correct label.

Fully connected output layer gives the final probabilities for each label.
 
Practical applications include predicting labels of images.
