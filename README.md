# Artificial-Intelligence

## Responses

# DAY 1 (2/8)
- I'm curious to learn all about Artificial Intelligence such as machine learning, computer vision, image processing, natural language processing, in the fields like finance and more. I would like to learn what else is out there and how to use it. And how to connect with professionals and start an internship or full-time.

1.What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning? 

Supervised learning is having the training data and knowing the outcome labels of those like cat or dog. Uses decision tree algorithm.
Unsupervised learning is having the training data then trying to group them into clusters to find similarity. Uses K nearest neighbor algorithm. 

2.Describe why the following statement is FALSE: Scikit-Learn has the power to visualize data without a Graphviz, Pandas, or other data analysis libraries.

Scikit Learn is focused on Machine Learning, e.g data modelling. It is not concerned with the loading, handling, manipulating, and visualising of data.
